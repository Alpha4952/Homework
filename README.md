# Some of my competitive programming codes
Most of them are in C++, others are in Python.
They're sorted in the problem sets my teacher gave me, using main problem they invole (DP, graph, etc).

These are the problems I solved long time ago, if given the chance to solve again, I might even do better because of the skills and experience I gained after years of learning.

Although the problems are in Vietnamese, you can use google translate or contact me to understand them better.

Feel free to ask me to explain anything if you want to, I just love doing random ahh things.
Side note: if you need quick response, check out my discord, I am almost always online, besides sleeping and some personal time
And check my timezone as well, I usually sleep from 11pm (23) to 6am (6), Sunday to 7 or 8am (7 or 8) and sometimes I stay up late

Ahh and the silly commits, I was just cheering myself after completing a hard task or something. No idea what my past self have been doing then. :D
